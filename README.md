A Comparison of Reproducibility Guidelines: A Case Study in Education
Une comparaison des directives de reproductibilité : une étude de cas dans l’éducation

Reproducibility of scientific findings is the core of scientific research. Scientists have proposed recommendations and suggested criterion for better scientific reproducibility, but the reproduction of actual scientific research may still be challenging even if the
research article meets the expectations. In
this project, we replicate the research article
by professor Benjamin T. Skinner. We
demonstrate the challenges of reproducing
a research article in education, even when
codes and data are shared openly and the
quality of the materials produced for reproducibility
are especially high. Moreover, we
investigated the implicit presumptions of the
researchers’ level of knowledge and discussed
how such presumptions may add difficulty to
the reproduction of scientific research. Finally,
we hope this article sheds light on the
design of reproducibility criterion and opens
up a space to explore what should be taught
in undergraduate statistics education.
