# Reproducibility in Theory

### What is Reproducibility?

__Reproducibility: Intersubjective consensus of scientific results among scientists__

*"If scientists or scientific teams independently and correctly apply the same
method of justification to the same subject matter, then they must reach the
same conclusions about this subject matter."*

-- _Holm Tetens `r Citep(bib, "tetens-2016")`_

### Why Reproducible Research?

- For future reference among peers
- For building consensus among scientists
- For communicating and promoting scientific results to the general public

# Who is involved in reproducible research?

#### Original Researchers
  + Document details of experiments and analysis 
  + Prepare readable codes and accessible data
  + Provide open access to the public
  
#### __Mediums__ (for both original researchers and reproducers)
  + What programming and scientific languages?
  + Which platforms for codes and data sharing?
  
#### __Reproducers__ (Do we have a better name for this?)  
  + Who are the target reproducers?
  + What do we expect from reproducers' skills? 
  + How do reproducers communicate their findings to build a network of results/reach a consensus on certain topic?

---

# Questions as Answers...

<br>

### How can we select a proper language and medium?

#### We need some standard. __Reproducibility guidelines__ may help! Now, what are the highlights of available reproducibility guidelines?


### How do we learn more about the reproducers?

#### From our practice experience. For example, from a __case study__! Action speaks louder than words. What type of research project should we select? A research project that meets the expectations of reproducibility guidelines may be a good starting point!

# TODAY'S GOAL

#### Demonstrate how the reproduction of a scientific research can still be challenging in unexpected ways even if the research project meets the expectations of reproducibility guidelines.


#### Provide constructive solutions to data accessibility, version management, training reproducers and better reproducibility guidelines.

# Background

The selected research article by Professor Benjamin T. Skinner `r Citep(bib, "skinner-2019B")` explores the association between broadband access and online course enrollment in the US from 2012 to 2014.

### Highlights of this Research

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("circle-check"),fill="green")` 16 different models
  - 3 ways to define broadband access: **download speed, upload speed, and the number of providers** (and all three variables)
  - 2 Bayesian regression models (single-level and multilevel) with 2 priors

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("circle-check"),fill="green")` Incorporate different software applications
  - 5 programs (R, CmdStan, Bash, git, SQLite); 14 R packages
  - 34 datasets from 6 different (government, GitHub...) sources  

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("circle-check"),fill="green")` Well-documented research project

# Case Study
### A Well-organized Repository `r Citep(bib, "skinner-2019A")`

.pull-right[
`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("circle-check"),fill="green")` Commented codes with generated results

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("circle-check"),fill="green")` A README file with instructions about execution for all folders

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("circle-check"),fill="green")` Information about software/computing environment

# Phase III:<br>Results and Pain Points

---

# Results

#### 1. The final results of 16 models are the same except that a few numbers differ in the thousandths digit

#### 2. Same tables and figures can be produced with the given codes

#### 3. Both single-level model and multilevel model provide a similar conclusion

# Pain Points

__It took me a week to reproduce the project.__

### `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("gear"),fill="#5bc2e7")` GNU Utility
### `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("database"),fill="#5bc2e7")` Data Accessibility
### `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("code-branch"),fill="#5bc2e7")` Version Management
### `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("r-project"),fill="#5bc2e7")` R Reproducibility

---

# `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("gear"),fill="#5bc2e7")` GNU Utility

### Ubuntu on Windows 10
- Additional Cost in Time and Effort
- Different mindsets

### `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("circle-xmark"),fill="red")` `cut -f4 -f5` `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("circle-check"),fill="green")` `cut -f4,5`
- Assume familiarity of different versions of the same function
- Hard to debug

---

# `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("database"),fill="#5bc2e7")` Data Accessibility

## Authors understandably cannot host the data. 

#### Datasets from 3 (out of 6) sources cannot be downloaded with provided codes

* Datasets are moved to archive

* The US broadband datasets are not accessible via UofT network

* Datasets with the same name have multiple versions

* The whole website has moved to another server

# `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("code-branch"),fill="#5bc2e7")` Version Management

#### `tidy` from the `broom` package is used to convert the fitted objects into a tidy dataframe. However, these methods are already moved to the `broom.mixed` package in 2021.


# `r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("r-project"),fill="#5bc2e7")` R Reproducibility

#### Dependencies will not be automatically downloaded.

#### `knitr` in RStudio is tricky.

# Summary

1. Data is not always available after the publication of the original research article, so we may need some workaround solutions.

1. In research reproduction, reproducers are expected to have certain problem-solving skills and technical knowledge, so they should be trained accordingly.

1. R reproducibility is beyond the scope of this presentation, so we will not discuss further.

# Discussion

<br>

### 1. Data Accessibility

### 2. Training (Undergraduate) Reproducers

### 3. Better Reproducibility Guidelines



---

# Workaround Solutions to Improve Data Accessiblity

#### Missing Datasets? Validation Subset!

1. Fit a distribution to a subset of the restricted data

2. `set.seed` and generate a sample

3. Clean the data and apply the final model on the data 

4. Provide the model outputs in the appendix

#### Multiple Versions of the Same Dataset?

Attach the Hash codes (an unique identifier) of the datasets in the appendix

### Benefits?

Avoid the problems of legal obligation; Reproducible and testable

# Guidelines Revisited 

#### Authors 

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("code-commit"),fill="#5bc2e7")` Code scripts and data `r Citep(bib, "yale-2010")`; Codes to generate result tables; Raw and cleaned data `r Citep(bib, "chang-2015")`

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("file-pen"),fill="#5bc2e7")` Identifiers for each version of codes, computing environment and software version `r Citep(bib, "yale-2010")`

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("file-pen"),fill="#5bc2e7")` Random seed; Order of execution; Model run time `r Citep(bib, "chang-2015")`

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("file-pen"),fill="#5bc2e7")` Justified and transparent methodology and data cleaning process `r Citep(bib, "ies-2018")`

#### Mediums

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("lock-open"),fill="#5bc2e7")` Open license, open access and non-proprietary formats `r Citep(bib, "yale-2010")`

#### Reproducers?
---

class: inverse, center, middle

# What about... reproducers?

*"The absence of a trait itself can have a positive value."*

-- _Slavoj Zizek `r Citep(bib, "zizek-1992")`_

---

# The Implicit Assumptions on Reproducers' Skills

#### The original researchers may unconciously assume that the reproducers have the same skill sets and understandings of the research projects.

1. Same domain knowledge (or assume the knowledge is transmissible) 

1. Familiarity with different *operating systems* (Unix, Windows, etc.) 

2. Knowledge in *programming languages* (R, Python, etc.) and *database* and *data structure*

5. Independent problem-solving skills (debugging from error messages, GitHub/Stack Exchange community, documentation, etc.)

#### Who will be the reproducers and how should we define reproducibility from a reproducer's perspective?
---

# If Undergraduate Students are Reproducers?

**If we expect the research project is reproducible by not only the original researchers/peer scholars but also undergraduate students, We may want to teach students important practical skills. The first step is to develop a more comprehensive and up-to-date undergraduate statistics curriculum.**

1. Statistics communities have provided useful discussions about undergraduate statistics teaching  `r Citep(bib, c("asa-2014", "de-veaux-2017","nolan-2010"))`

2. For example, SQL is rarely taught in introductory data science courses `r Citep(bib, "schwab-mccoy-2021")`, but is very popular in academia and industry `r Citep(bib, "ucb-2021")`

2. Teaching Python/R with SQL on various operating systems is also feasible and can be effective `r Citep(bib, c("brunner-2016","loy-2019"))`

---

# Better Reproducibility Guidelines

#### The guidelines should also cover the following aspects:

1. Long-term accessibility of open data: Increase reproducibility when the original authors cannot host all data 

1. Platforms to host codes and data with version management within an appropriate container (docker)

1. Specify the expectations on the reproducers' skills

1. __Decide a better name for "reproducer" if possible!__
